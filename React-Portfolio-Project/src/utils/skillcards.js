    firstHeader: 'React Fundamentals',
    firstPara: "I follow a structured learning path of React concepts. My projects focus on efficiency and best practices.\n\nI prefer learning from the ground up, and generally avoid pre-built components until I can build it comfortably from scratch. This approach has helped me understand the inner workings of React and its ecosystem.",
    secondHeader: 'Learning Roadmap',
    secondPara: "I'm currently developing a robust application with Next.js and Typescript to improve my full stack competency.\n\nAs my projects scale up I plan to further embrace performance optimization and SEO considerations. To avoid becoming too specialized I make sure to revisit raw Javascript from time to time.",

    title: 'Generative AI \nIntegration',
    firstHeader: 'UI/UX Optimization',
    firstPara: "User-driven content generation is flawed due to the sub-optimal UI's of AI tools.\n\nI envision ways to improve UX with creative solutions that take into account the translation gap between AI and human users.",
    secondHeader: 'Opening Creative Doors',
    secondPara: "Generative AI helps me tap into a creative side that I am working to express more. I believe it holds that potential for just about everyone.\n\nThe buzz around this technology offers a chance to engage those who might not usually explore their creativity, fostering new ideas and innovation.",

    firstHeader: 'FE/BE Challenges',
    firstPara: "Unraveling the complexity of the front-end/back-end relationship was ultimately the most rewarding part of my journey thus far.\n\nThe first major challenge I encountered was integrating a Vue FE with a Django BE. This pivotal moment almost made me quit, but instead I turned my frustration into fuel.\n\nAside from Django, I have also deployed server-side code using Express.js and Flask. SQL is a part of my daily workflow; I use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio extensively.",

    firstHeader: 'Inspiration At Home',
    firstPara: "I've drawn inspiration from loved ones for projects like my Wordle clone with added features and TADA!, a mindful take on the traditional TO-DO list.\n\n In TADA!, users receive AI-generated affirmations for their accomplishments.",
    secondHeader: 'Practical Solutions',
    secondPara: "When I first discovered the power of Python scripting, I was motivated to automate everything. I've created scripts to streamline daily workflows, manage personal emails, and scrape web data using Selenium.\n\n One of my mid-term goals is to develop a Chrome Extension inspired by uBlock Origin's DOM filtering feature.",
